sourcecode and documentation: https://github.com/abertschi/postcards

```

## Getting started
Create a configuration file by issuing 
```bash
$ postcards generate
```
A [configuration file](./postcards/template_config.json) 
holds various information relevant to send postcards.
 
### Examples
Issue `postcards send --help` for more information about sending postcards.

```bash
# Send a postcard
$ postcards send --config config.json \
    --picture https://images.pexels.com/photos/365434/pexels-photo-365434.jpeg \
    --message "Happy coding!"


# Encrypt user passwords to store in configuration file
$ postcards encrypt mypassword


# Send a postcard with encrypted passwords stored in configuration file
$ postcards send --config config.json \
    --key \
    --picture https://images.pexels.com/photos/365434/pexels-photo-365434.jpeg \
    --message "Happy coding"
    
# Increase verbosity
$ postcards -v send --config config.json \
    --picture https://images.pexels.com/photos/365434/pexels-photo-365434.jpeg \
    --message "Happy coding!"

# - Add more 'v' to increase verbosity, i.e. -vv
# - Note: The -v / --verbose flag belongs to the root parser, add it after 'postcards' and before 'send'     
    
```

## Plugins
Postcards is designed in a plugin based approach. 
Plugins set the text and / or picture of your postcards.

Postcard pictures and text can always be overwritten by commandline by issuing 
`--picture <picutre>` and `--message <message>`.

These plugins are available:
- [Plugin: postcards-folder](#plugin-postcards-folder)
- [Plugin: postcards-yaml](#plugin-postcards-yaml)
- [Plugin: postcards-pexels](#plugin-postcards-pexels)
- [Plugin: postcards-random](#plugin-postcards-random)
- [Plugin: postcards-chuck-norris](#plugin-postcards-chuck-norris)
- [Build your own plugin](#build-your-own-plugin)

### Plugin: postcards-folder
Send pictures from a folder.  

Add the following object to your configuration file
```json
{
 "payload": {
    "folder": "./pictures",
    "move": true
  }
}
```

- `folder`: location to a folder containing your images (required)
- `move`: set to false if sent picture should not be moved to a subdirectory `./sent/` (default: true)

#### Example
```
$ postcards-folder send --config ./my-config.json --message "coding rocks"
```
#### Slice a picture into tiles
`postcards-folder` comes with a command called `slice` to create tiles from an image.
This is useful to create a poster-like picture with postcards.

Issue `postcards-folder slice --help` for more information.

### Plugin: postcards-yaml
Specify what picture and text to send in a YAML file. This allows for scripted bulk sending
and extends `postcards-folder` with a YAML file.


Add the following object to your configuration file (`config.json`);
```json
{
 "payload": {
    "folder": "./pictures",
    "yaml": "./pictures/send.yaml",
    "move": true
  }
}
```

Create a YAML file in the following format;

```yaml
- This is the text for postcard 1
- this-location-to-picture-1.jpg
- This is the text for postcard 2
- this-is-location-to-picture-2.jpg
```

- Entry `i` contains text, and entry `i+1` contains the relative location of the picture.
- For all `i modulo 2 == 0`, `i >= 0`
- The absolute location of the image consists of the `folder` path in `config.json` and the image location in the YAML file.
- Entries are removed from the YAML file if a postcard is sent.
- Entries are picked as they appear in the YAML file.

#### Example
```
$ postcards-yaml send --config ./config.json
```
- see directory `./example/plugin_yaml/` for more examples.

#### Validate YAML file
You can verify the YAML file with `postcards-yaml validate -c config.json`.
This command checks that all pictures exist and the YAML file has
proper format.

### Plugin: postcards-pexels  
Send postcards with random pictures from www.pexels.com.

No configuration is necessary in your configuration file.

#### Example
```
$ postcards-pexels send --config ./config.json --message "coding rocks"
```

### Plugin: postcards-random
Surprise, surprise! This plugin chooses an arbitrary picture from the 
internet as postcard picture.
Picture may be inappropriate, so use with caution.

No configuration is necessary in your configuration file.
Needs python 3.6, newer versions cause some errors (TODO).

#### Example
```
$ postcards-random send --config ./config.json \
  --message "So much of life, it seems to me, is determined by pure randomness. \
   So is this postcard picture."
```

### Plugin: postcards-chuck-norris  
Chuck Norris's first program was kill -9!

Receive postcards with Chuck Norris statements.
No configuration is necessary in your configuration file.

#### Example
```
$ postcards-chuck-norris send --config ./config.json --category nerdy --duplicate-file duplicates.txt
```
- Issue `postcards-chuck-norris send --help` for more information about the additional flags.

### Build your own plugin
1. Extend the class `postcards.Postcards()`
2. Overwrite `def get_img_and_text(self, payload, cli_args)`
3. Add CLI parser functionality by overwriting `enhance_*_subparser` methods

```python
from postcards.postcards import Postcards
import sys

class MyPlugin(Postcards):

    def get_img_and_text(self, plugin_config, cli_args):
      return {
            'img': '...',
            'text': '...'
        }
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyPlugin().main(sys.argv[1:])
        
```
```sh
$ python my_plugin.py --help
```
